        <h2>My top movies</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>Hamilton - The Musical</h3>
        <p>A masterpiece in my eyes, how did such a spectacular piece of work come to fruition?  Alexander Hamilton's biography, through Lin-Manuel Miranda. </p>
        <h3>Couple's Retreat</h3>
        <p>A classic from way back in the relationship days. </p>
        <h3>Pride & Prejudice</h3>
        <p>The version with Kiera Knightley was always a favourite.  I liked the actor they cast as Mr. Darcy, too. </p>
